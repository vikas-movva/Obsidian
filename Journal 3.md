## Peer Conference Experience
I found that the Peer Conference was a learning and rewarding experience. Presenting to my group  gave me an opportunity to reflect on my personal habits, challenges, and growth as a student. I started off by identifying the main areas that influenced my academic journey which was procrastination, poor sleep, time management, test anxiety, and motivation. Each of these factors was a genuine struggle in my university life.

During preparation, I spent time structuring my slides to ensure clarity and flow. I used visuals, minimal text, and key takeaways for each factor in order to not read off the slides and keep my audience engaged. I rehearsed multiple times, focusing on pacing and tone, but I initially relied too heavily on my notes. My peers, pointed this out in the feedback they noticed that at the start I read from my tablet (notes) but became more confident and natural later on. This transition reflected my growing comfort during the presentation and my ability to adapt in the moment.

Public speaking has always been somewhat intimidating for me, doubly so when discussing my personal struggles like procrastination and anxiety. However, through this conference, I realized that authenticity resonates more than perfection and everyone struggles with these kind of things, not just me. By being open and reflective, I connected better with my peers. Many nodded in agreement when I spoke about shared struggles like test anxiety or poor sleep, which made the experience more conversational and less like a presentation.

From watching my peers, I also picked up strategies to improve my delivery. For example, one classmate used storytelling in their presentation, which made it engaging and memorable. Another used humor and movement to hold attention. These approaches reminded me that good public speaking is not just about what you are presenting but also about presence and energy.

## Results and Feedback Reflection
My peers, scored my presentation 23/30 on average, a result that I feel fairly represents my effort and delivery. The detailed breakdown highlighted strengths in content and connection to research and identified areas for improvement in slide design.

I appreciated their comment about my clarity and confident delivery, this made me feel that my practice paid off. They also asked an insightful questions about my test anxiety and other struggles that i had such as: “How much does it affect your test outcomes?” That question in particular made me think more deeply about quantifying the impact of anxiety on my academic performance and made me realize that i could have elaborated on that topic more in my presentation.

The constructive feedback about relying less on notes was fair and valuable. It’s something I noticed myself during the presentation, once I moved away from the script, my body language and engagement improved significantly. This reinforces a key lesson for me which is: preparation builds confidence, but over-reliance on a script/notes takes away from authenticity and a connection to the audience.

## Individual Learning
I found the 1-1-1 feedback surprisingly impactful. Even though it was brief, it gave me honest and thoughtful insight into how others saw my presentation. After reading it I realized the following things about my presentation:

I had a clear and articulation delivery as well as a strong research integration. One area that I could improve on was the visual design of my slides and reduce reading from notes. Finally I could explore deeper on the personal impact of my five factors.

For the Capstone presentation, I plan to apply these lessons by focusing more on storytelling and interactive engagement. I’ll redesign my slides with consistent colours, creating a better balance between text and visuals, and larger fonts for readability. I’ll also rehearse enough to internalize my content fully, allowing me to speak naturally without depending on notes.

This experience taught me that self-awareness and feedback are essential to growth. I learned not just how to present better, but how to connect with my peers, my material, and my audience. The feedback I received was constructive, fair, and motivating. Going forward, I will strive to use this feedback in my future academic and professional presentations, aiming for a delivery that is both confident and authentic.
