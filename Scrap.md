In baseball, a batter stands 2 feet from the home plate as a pitcher throws the ball towards home plate with a velocity of 150 ft/s. Suppose:

I) a(t) represents the batter's angle of gaze (in radians) between the ball and home plate at time t and 

II) b(t) represents the distance (in ft) between the ball and home plate at time t

Determine the rate at which the batter's angle of gaze must change in order to keep his eyes on the ball as it crosses home plate
