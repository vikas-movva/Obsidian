find the antiderivative of $f(x) = 50\left( \frac{2+x^2}{1+x^2} \right)$

Find the function $f$ that has a slope $\frac{3+\cos^3(x)}{\cos^2(x)}$ for $x \in \left[ 0,\frac{\pi}{2} \right]$ and passes through the point $(0,-2)$

A home owner is building a garden containing three rectangular plots. Fencing will surround the garden and separate each plot.

(a) Let $x$ represent the width of the entire garden and $y$ the length of each plot. If the owner has 400 meters of fencing state the possible range of the indapendant variables $x$ and $y$  representing the dimensions of the fence


A painting of height 3 feet hangs on a wall of a museum, with the bottom of the painting 1 foot above the eye of an observer. How far from the wall should the observer stand to maximize their angle of vision? (In other words, where should the observer stand as to maximize the angle subtended at her eye by the painting?) Use the first derivative test to verify that the result is a maximum.

$f(x)=x^2 -3x$
Recall that $\int _{a}^b f(x)\, dt = \lim_{ n \to \infty }\frac{b-a}{n}\sum f(a+ \frac{b-a}{n}i$. Verify $\int _{0}^{12}f(x) \, dx = 360$ result by evaluating this limit.

$[\frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{3}{2}x^2]_{a}^b = \frac{1}{3}b^3 - \frac{3}{2}b^2 - (\frac{1}{3}a^3 - \frac{3}{2}a^2)$ $= \frac{1}{3}(b^3 - 3a^3 + 3a^2b - 3ab^2)$
