A multi-class classifier produced the following confusion matrix for three possible classes: Cold, Allergy, and Strep Throat.

|                      | Cold (Predicted) | Allergy (Predicted) | Strep Throat (Predicted) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Cold (Actual)        | 22               | 12                  | 6                        |
| Allergy(Actual)      | 10               | 18                  | 9                        |
| Strep Throat(Actual) | 7                | 8                   | 35                       |

Based on this confusion matrix, which of the following statement is true?

Question 8 options:

The classifier has more false positives for Cold than for Allergy.
