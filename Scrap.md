Learning how to study and creating good study habits is essential for being successful at school. Many students entering university are dealing with a different difficulty level of courses, new topics, and a new environment which all can affect not only how they learn but their academic performance. It is essential for students in first year to determine what type of study habits work best for them. 

One often used method for encouraging productive work and study is the formation of study groups. These groups can consist of peers in a similar program or the same course. It creates the opportunity for students to come together and encourage a time for working on their school work. This can be to ensure they schedule time for studying, or the opportunity to ask questions and work on problems with other students. 

You have been hired by Wilfrid Laurier University to design an experience suited towards first-year students who would like to join a study group to help them in their program and / or courses. The goal is to promote academic success through social studying and interaction.

When starting university, these first year students face many challenges. Some move on their own and need to meet new people. Others are not so successful.

Wilfrid Laurier has decided that it needs to create some sort of experience to assist these students.

you are a smart design thinker, you know that before it is decided what this experience might look like you must conduct research to learn more about these users and generate empathy for them and their situation.

Your first job as a consultant for Wilfrid Laurier University is to learn more about these users. First, create a research plan that will help you learn more about your users. What primary and secondary sources will you use that will help you understand their needs and their problems? (it is not necessary to contact or interview any primary resources you identify here, it is just important that you come up with some ideas of people you could talk to).

Next, from your research, generate an empathy map, two personas, and a journey map that describes the experience these immigrants face when coming to Ontario. Keep in mind you are trying to empathize and understand their position, and these tools will help you communicate your findings to others.

Your assignment should consist of the following:
1. A title page with your name and the assignment subject
2. An introduction to the assignment and the problem (250 words or more)
3. A research strategy plan that could be used to learn more about the users (2 pages)
4. An empathy map
5. Two personas
6. A journey map
