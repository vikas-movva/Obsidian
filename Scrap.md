Solve $\lim_{ x \to 0 } \frac{\int_{0}^x \tan(t^2)\ln(\cos(t)) \, dt}{\int_{0}^x \tan(t^2)\ln(e^{t^2}) \, dt}$


Consider the function
$$f(x)=e^{-x}-\frac{x^5}{20}+x^2$$

(a) Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that there is one point x = a
such that f ′′ (a) = 0.
(b) Prove that there is only one point for which f ′′ (a) = 0 [Hint: look at the
third derivative]. Is this an inflection point? Explain.
(c) Assume that f ′′ (x) > 0 for x < a and f ′′ (x) < 0 for x > a. What does the
first derivative test (applied to f ′ ) say about f ′ (x)?
(d) Use the result obtained in part (c) to determine the number of critical
points of f 

Evaluate the integral  $\int _{0}^1 (4x-3x^3)\, dx$ by using Riemann sums with equal width subinterval division of [0, 1], RIGHT end-points and limits.



Suppose that $f$ satisfies the equation  $\cos\left( \frac{3\pi}{4}x \right)=\int _{0}^{x^3} f(t) \, dt$ Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to differentiate both sides of this expression, then find f (1).


evaluate this integral using integration by parts $\int x^6(x^7+5) \, dx$ where $u=x^6$ and $dv=(x^7+5)$


Determine the partial fractions decomposition/expansion and solve for
