# Collective Action Plan for Sustained Self-Regulation in Future Semesters

As a group, we have collectively moved out of Pre-contemplation and Contemplation and are now distributed across Preparation (Aleana), Action (Kevin, Jaiveer), and Maintenance (Lavina, Vikas, Rachid). Our shared goal for future semesters is to bring everyone into solid Maintenance while building a relapse-resistant support system that keeps self-regulation as a permanent part of our identity and lifestyle.  

We will achieve this by intentionally and collectively applying the Processes of Change from the Transtheoretical Model in a coordinated, group-wide way.

### Collective Action Steps + Linked Processes of Change

1. **Self-Liberation (Commitment) + Consciousness Raising**  
   → We will formally renew our commitment together at the start of every semester.  
   **Action:** Create and sign a shared “SAS Graduate Pact (Google Doc) where each person writes their personal “Why this matters to me now” statement + 3 non-negotiable self-regulation habits for the semester. We will read them aloud in our first group call.  
   This turns self-regulation into a core part of our identity (Self-reevaluation) and uses the group ritual to strengthen Self-liberation.

2. **Helping Relationships + Social Liberation**  
   → Establish a permanent SAS Graduate Support Circle (WhatsApp or Discord group named “SAS Survivors 2025+”).  
   **Weekly rituals (mandatory for everyone in Action stage, strongly encouraged for Maintenance):**  
   - Sunday evening check-in (voice note or text): “What went well this week? Where did I slip? What do I need next week?”  
   - Wednesday “Body Double” Pomodoro sessions (2–3 hours on Zoom, cameras on, mute, just working together).  
   - Monthly 90-minute group call (first Sunday of every month) to review progress, celebrate wins, and adjust strategies.  
   This creates ongoing social support (Helping relationships) and reinforces that “everyone who made it through SAS is now disciplined” – changing the social norm in our circle (Social liberation).

3. **Reinforcement Management**  
   → Create a collective reward system that only unlocks when everyone completes their weekly commitments.  
   **Examples:**  
   - Everyone hits their study/consistency targets for the month → group pays for a celebratory dinner or escape room in December/April.  
   - If someone misses two weeks in a row without valid reason → they fund coffee/boba for the next group meet-up.  
   This increases rewards for positive behaviour and decreases rewards for slipping (group pressure in a caring way).

4. **Stimulus Control (Group Edition)**  
   → Shared digital ecosystem:  
   - One master Google Calendar (shared with everyone) where we put all our midterms, assignments, and personal deadlines.  
   - Everyone adds their weekly study blocks so we can see when someone is free for body-double sessions.  
   - Phone/laptop wallpaper for every member will be a screenshot of the group pact + a motivational quote we choose together.  
   Removing individual isolation cues and adding constant reminders of the group standard.

5. **Counter Conditioning + Self-Reevaluation (Ongoing Identity Work)**  
   → Monthly “Identity Night” on our group call:  
   Each person answers:  
   - “This month I proved I am the kind of student who…”  
   - “The old version of me would have…, but new me did…”  
   This deliberately substitutes old self-talk with new, competent identity and reinforces Self-reevaluation continuously (crucial for Maintenance).

6. **Dramatic Relief & Environmental Reevaluation (Relapse Prevention)**  
   → We will keep a shared “Wall of Almost-Relapse” channel in our group chat.  
   Any time someone feels the pull to procrastinate, skip class, pull an all-nighter, or go back to old habits, they must post:  
   “Almost relapsed because… but I chose… instead.”  
   The group responds with support and reminders of past pain (Dramatic relief) and how much better life is now (Environmental reevaluation – better health, sleep, grades, pride, family reactions, etc.).

7. **Maintenance-Specific Process: Contingency Management for Long-Term**  
   → At the end of every semester we will do a full group review:  
   - Each person presents evidence of maintained habits (screenshots of planner, grades, sleep tracker, etc.).  
   - We vote on who has truly reached Maintenance.  
   - Those in solid Maintenance become official “Mentors” for anyone still in Action the following semester (extra accountability + status reward).

### Accountability & Support Structure Going Forward

|Role | Person(s) | Responsibility|
|-|----------|---------------|
| Consistency Captain (rotates monthly) | Everyone takes a turn | Posts Sunday check-in prompt, tracks who responded, gently follows up with missing people by Monday night |
| Reward Treasurer | Lavina & Vikas (they’re already in Maintenance) | Manages the group reward fund and announces when we’ve earned celebrations |
| Relapse First-Responder Squad | Jaiveer & Rachid (both bounced back strong from slips) | Anyone posts in “Wall of Almost-Relapse” → these two must reply within 2 hours with support/strategy |
| New Semester Onboarding | All Maintenance members | Personally call/text anyone who seems to be slipping at the start of a new semester with a “We’ve got you, remember who you are now” message |


If anyone goes silent for more than one week without explanation → automatic wellness check call from two group members (we will not let anyone disappear like we almost did before SAS).

We are no longer individual students struggling alone.  
We are the SAS cohort that beat the required-to-withdraw and came back stronger.  
From this point forward, self-regulation is not just personal — it is our shared culture.  
We protect it together.

Based on the personal narratives, the definition of success provided, and the **Processes of Change** chart, here is the Collective Action Plan. This plan is designed to ensure the group carries their current momentum into future semesters, moving away from the "victim mindset" and procrastination that defined their past, toward the self-regulation and consistency defined as success.

### **Collective Action Plan: Future Semesters**

**Objective:** To transition our collective academic identity from "struggling students" to "self-regulated learners" by applying the Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change) to future academic challenges.

---

#### **1. Pre-Contemplation $\rightarrow$ Contemplation**

_Goal: To overcome the denial or "victim mindset" that previously led to failure (as seen in Lavina and Aleana’s pasts) and recognize when new bad habits begin to form._

- **Collective Action:** We will implement a "Bi-Weekly Reality Check." Instead of waiting for a "Required to Withdraw" email to wake us up, we will proactively audit our behaviors.
    
- **Process of Change: Consciousness Raising**
    
    - **Action:** We will actively seek facts about our current performance by checking our grades on Learning Management Systems every two weeks, rather than avoiding them. If we find ourselves skipping a class or missing a reading, we will treat this as a "symptom" requiring immediate attention, rather than ignoring it as "just one time."
        
- **Process of Change: Environmental Reevaluation**
    
    - **Action:** We will reflect on how our behavior affects our future environment. We will acknowledge that failing a course now does not just hurt our GPA, it financially impacts our families (as noted by Aleana and Jaiveer) and delays our entry into the workforce.
        

#### **2. Contemplation $\rightarrow$ Preparation**

_Goal: To move from thinking about change to emotionally and logically preparing for it, ensuring we don't get stuck in "analysis paralysis."_

- **Collective Action:** We will shift our mindset from "I have to do this" to "I want to be this person."
    
- **Process of Change: Self-Reevaluation**
    
    - **Action:** We will redefine our identities. Instead of seeing ourselves as "procrastinators" or "business owners who don't have time for school," we will visualize ourselves as capable scholars. As implied by the success definition, we will accept that being a successful student is a core part of our identity, not just a side task.
        
- **Process of Change: Dramatic Relief**
    
    - **Action:** We will not shy away from the anxiety of potential failure. Instead of suppressing the fear (which led to avoidance for Kevin), we will use that anxiety constructively to fuel our preparation. We will channel the fear of the "Required to Withdraw" email into the motivation to set up our semester correctly.
        

#### **3. Preparation $\rightarrow$ Action**

_Goal: To set up the systems that make "doing the work" the path of least resistance._

- **Collective Action:** Before the first day of the semester, we will establish our "Infrastructure of Success."
    
- **Process of Change: Self-Liberation**
    
    - **Action:** We will make a firm commitment—verbalized to our support network (parents, SAS peers)—that we are approaching the semester differently. We will sign a personal contract to attend every class.
        
- **Process of Change: Helping Relationships**
    
    - **Action:** We will identify our support pillars early. Just as Lavina used her partner/sister and Aleana used financial advisors, we will list exactly who we will contact if we struggle (e.g., "If I fail a midterm, I will immediately email the prof," rather than waiting).
        

#### **4. Action $\rightarrow$ Maintenance**

_Goal: To actively execute the habits of self-regulation (planning, sleep, mindfulness) daily._

- **Collective Action:** We will operationalize the tools that worked for us in SAS (Planners, Pomodoro, SMART goals).
    
- **Process of Change: Counter Conditioning**
    
    - **Action:** When the urge to procrastinate arises (the problem behavior), we will immediately substitute it with a "micro-step" (the alternative behavior). For example, if Vikas feels burnout, instead of "escaping," he will do just _one_ Pomodoro session. If Jaiveer feels the urge to prioritize business over school during exam week, he will substitute it with a strict "Study Block" before business hours.
        
- **Process of Change: Stimulus Control**
    
    - **Action:** We will curate our environments to remove cues for failure.
        
        - _Kevin & Jaiveer:_ Will physically remove phones/distractions during deep work sessions.
            
        - _Lavina:_ Will keep the planner open on the desk as a visual cue (reminder) to engage in the recommended behavior.
            
- **Process of Change: Reinforcement Management**
    
    - **Action:** We will replicate Lavina’s "Reward System." We will decrease rewards for problem behavior (no video games/socializing if work isn't done) and increase rewards for positive behavior (guilt-free time off after finishing the weekly to-do list).
        

#### **5. Maintenance $\rightarrow$ Preventing Relapse**

_Goal: To ensure these behaviors persist even when SAS supervision ends and stress increases._

- **Collective Action:** We will normalize these behaviors as our "new normal" and support each other in resilience.
    
- **Process of Change: Social Liberation**
    
    - **Action:** We will realize and embrace that social norms for us have changed. It is now "normal" for our group to say "No" to hanging out if work isn't done (as Kevin learned to do). We will surround ourselves with peers who support this academic focus, realizing that society (and the university) supports our health behavior change.
        
- **Process of Change: Helping Relationships (Recycled for Maintenance)**
    
    - **Action:** We will maintain a group chat or check-in system post-SAS. When one of us slips (like Lavina’s asthma week or Jaiveer’s business rush), the group will provide the social support needed to "get back on the horse" immediately, preventing a slip from becoming a full relapse.
        

### **Next Steps**

Would you like me to create a specific **Weekly Planner Template** or a **relapse-prevention checklist** based on the specific "Counter Conditioning" strategies mentioned in this plan?
