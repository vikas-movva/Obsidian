if $w\prime(t)$ is the rate of growth of a child in pounds per year, what does $\int _{5}^{10} w\prime(t)\, dt$ represent?

A population of cattle is increasing at a rate of 100+80𝑡 per year, where 𝑡 is measured in years. By how much does the population increase between years 6 and 9?

Evaluate the indefinite integral: $\int \frac{4x-1}{(4x^2 -2x+3)^4} \, dx$. Don't forget the constant of integration.

Evaluate the indefinite integral: $\int x^5\sqrt{ 8+x^6 }\, dx$. Don't forget the constant of integration.

Evaluate the indefinite integral: $\int\frac{\cos(x)}{7\sin(x)+35}\, dx$. Don't forget the constant of integration.

Evaluate the indefinite integral: $\int 10e^{\cos(x)}\sin(x)\, dx$. Don't forget the constant of integration.

Evaluate the definite integral: $\int_{\frac{\pi}{6}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}  \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin^8(x)}\, dx$
