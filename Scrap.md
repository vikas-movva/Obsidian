Hey, whats up guys. I finally decided to track my gym progress on here from the recommendation of Mr. Deval Patel. I did arms and shoulders today and the pump is looking good, sheeesh. this is the workout that i did courtesy of Rahul. as for food: i drank a protein shake with 2 scoops of the leanfit protein you get at costco for breakfast, and four bonless skinless chicken thighs marinated in a bunch of indian spices and rice for dinner. dont know how long this series is gonna last but like and subscribe.
