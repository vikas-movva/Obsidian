Solve $\lim_{ x \to \infty } x^{\ln(2)/(1+\ln(x))}$ Indicate all points at which L'Hopital's rule is applied

Suppose, at time $t=0$, a penny is dropped from a bridge that is 122.5m from the ground. Ignoring air resistance, the distance the penny is from the ground $t$ seconds after it is dropped is then given by $s(t)=122.5-4.9t^2$. Since $s(t)$ is a polynomial it is continuous and differentiable for all $t$. Use the Mean Value Theorem to show that the velocity of the penny is at least -24.5 m/s at some point during its decent. Show all of your work
