Evaluate the definite integral $\int _{0}^{\pi/2} \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)-5}\, dx$


Use substitution to evaluate the following integral by hand $\int  \frac{3^t}{\sqrt{ 3^t + 4 }}\, dt$



A bacteria population grows at a rate of : $r\prime(t) = \sqrt{ t }\cos(t^{3/2}+1)+\frac{250}{1+t^2}$, where $t$ is in hours.

Evaluate $\int _{0}^{1} r\prime(t)\, dt$ (to the closest integer). Give a physical interpretation of the result.
