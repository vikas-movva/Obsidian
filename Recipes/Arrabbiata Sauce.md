### Ingredients
#### Sauce
- 1 (28-oz.) can whole tomatoes
- 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- 2 tbsp. tomato paste
- 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more as needed
- 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice (optional)
#### Pasta
- 2 tbsp. kosher salt
- 6 oz. tubed pasta (penne or rigatoni)
- 2 tbsp. grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 tbsp. fresh basil

### Directions
#### Sauce
1. Step 1 - Drain tomatoes, reserving juice, and tear or chop into 1/2" pieces. Add tomatoes back to reserved juice and set aside.

2. Step 2 - In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until paste darkens and begins to stick to bottom of skillet, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes and their juices and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, occasionally mashing down on tomato chunks, until sauce is thickened and reduced by about one-third, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and lemon juice for acidity, if needed.

3. Step 3 - **Make Ahead:** Sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool, then transfer to an airtight container and chill.
#### Pasta
1. Step 1 - Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Cook pasta until very al dente (2 to 3 minutes less than the package instructions). Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.

2. Step 2 - Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium heat, heat 1 cup arrabbiata sauce. Add drained pasta along with 1/4 cup pasta cooking liquid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, tossing constantly and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until pasta is al dente and sauce is glossy and coats pasta, 4 to 5 minutes.

3. Step 3 - Top with Parmesan and basil.
