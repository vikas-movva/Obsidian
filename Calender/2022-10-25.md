## Quick summary of the day/thoughts
spent 5 hours trying to debug C code and made me realize how much i hate C debugging in vscode. Definitely need to figure out that in the future or im gonna have the urge to blow my brains out every time i do an assignment in C.

Made preliminary outline for ml-demo site and researched some components that i can use. Have a rough idea of what kind of site i want. Might be better to just scale it down and just get it done. Dont really have much time until it needs to be done

Probably should start finishing up resume and sending emails to ppl asking for internships and applying to random ass companies. time to spray and pray ðŸ’€.
