### What is World Mana
- Neutral Mana is the most commonly encountered mana. 
- If it comes in contact with [[02 Attributed Mana|Attributed Mana]] it slowly erodes it back to [[01 World Mana|Neutral Mana]] 
- [[01 World Mana|Neutral Mana]] can be used for spell casting but it is not very effective.  a fireball spell using [[02 Attributed Mana|Attributed Mana]] is 100x more mana efficient than the same spell using [[01 World Mana|Neutral Mana]].
- [[01 World Mana|Neutral Mana]] has strong [[Anti-Magic]] properties so instead of using it for spells most people manipulate its shape to make [[Anti-Magic]] barriers or [[Anti-Magic Zones]].
