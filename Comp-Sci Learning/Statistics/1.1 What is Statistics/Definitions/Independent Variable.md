The independent variable is the factor that researchers manipulate or control in an experiment or study. It is the presumed cause or predictor of changes or variations in the dependent variable.
Researchers intentionally change or vary the independent variable to observe its effect on the dependent variable.
In an experiment, the independent variable is typically placed on the x-axis of a graph or table.
Example: In a study investigating the effects of different doses of a drug on patients' heart rates, the independent variable is the dosage of the drug because researchers can control and change the dosage.
