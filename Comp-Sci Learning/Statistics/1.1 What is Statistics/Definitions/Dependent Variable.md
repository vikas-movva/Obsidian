The dependent variable is the factor that researchers measure, observe, or analyze in response to changes in the independent variable. It is the outcome or result that may be influenced by the independent variable.
The dependent variable is what researchers are trying to understand, explain, or predict in an experiment or study.
In a graph or table, the dependent variable is typically placed on the y-axis.
Example: In the drug dosage study mentioned earlier, the dependent variable is the patients' heart rate, as it is what researchers are measuring to determine the effects of the drug dosage.
