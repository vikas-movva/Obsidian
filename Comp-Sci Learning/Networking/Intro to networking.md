### What is a network?
My understanding: A network is an interconnected group of computers

#defn [[Networking]]: A system that allows multiple devices to communicate with one another.

At a workplace or at home there are a variety of devices such as printers, smart home IOT devices, laptops, phones, etc. 

All these devices need to be connected together somehow. One way to do this is to run cables from each device into a [[Switch]]

Another way is to wirelessly connect devices together using a Wireless Access Point (Wi-Fi). You can also have a combined network with both switches and wireless access points.

### Protocols
Weather devices are wired or wireless they need to communicate with each other and speak the same language in a sense. 

This is where protocols are important. _A protocol is a way for devices to agree upon how data is sent, received and handled._

Some different protocols that are popular:
- Ethernet
- TCP
- UDP
	- The above protocols are used to send information from one device to another
- HTTP
- HTTPS
	- The above protocols are used to send webpages 
- SMTP
	- Used specifically for sending and receiving emails

Most of the time multiple protocols are used in conjunction for a given task.

### Different types of networks
Usually devices on a network are connected to a switch which is connected to a router.
Devices on the network are called _hosts_ or _endpoints_. 

Networks come in different sizes. For example a SOHO (Small Office, Home Office) network is small in nature that typically have a couple of computers, some phones, a printer , a TV, etc. which might be connected to Wi-Fi or are cabled into a switch.

In a SOHO network a router is used to connect to the internet. It is very common in this type of network for the switch, Wireless Access Point, and the router to be all in one single device.

An Enterprise network is a network used by businesses that is large in nature and might connect hundreds of computers together and span multiple floors of a building.

A service provider network is a kind of network that might connect you to the rest of the internet

When devices are collected into a small area we can call this a LAN (Local Area Network). A LAN can be as small as a SOHO network and as big as an Enterprise network.

When multiple networks are connected together we call this a WAN (wide area network)



Quiz Questions:
1. What are the two ways computers can connect to a network?
	- Wired using a Switch or wireless using a Wireless Access Point
2. What devices do computers usually connect to?
	- Other computers
3. How many protocols are used when one computer accesses another computer?
	- One or more
4. Your company has three divisions. Each group has a network, and all the networks are joined together. Is this still a LAN or is it something else?
	- In this case, since there are multiple networks connected together this would be a WAN
5. The company adds a retail division. there is a head office and six branch offices. what type of network is this 
	- In this case each different office would have its own LAN and if they are all connected together it would be a WAN
