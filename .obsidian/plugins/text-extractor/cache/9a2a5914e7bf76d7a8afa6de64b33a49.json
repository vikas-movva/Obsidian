A binary relation from A to B is a subset of AB.  In other words, for a binary relation R we have R  AB. We use the notation aRb to denote that (a, b)R and aRb to denote that (a, b)R. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 59 Relations  When (a, b) belongs to R, a is said to be related to b by R.  Example: Let P be a set of people, C be a set of cars, and D be the relation describing which person drives which car(s).  P = {Carl, Suzanne, Peter, Carla},  C = {Mercedes, BMW, tricycle}  D = {(Carl, Mercedes), (Suzanne, Mercedes), (Suzanne, BMW), (Peter, tricycle)}  This means that Carl drives a Mercedes, Suzanne drives a Mercedes and a BMW, Peter drives a tricycle, and Carla does not drive any of these vehicles. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 60 Functions as Relations  You might remember that a function f from a set A to a set B assigns a unique element of B to each element of A.  The graph of f is the set of ordered pairs (a, b) such that b = f(a).  Since the graph of f is a subset of AB, it is a relation from A to B.  Moreover, for each element a of A, there is exactly one ordered pair in the graph that has a as its first element. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 61 Functions as Relations  A function is a relation which has an additional property: ◼ if both (x,y) and (x,z) are in the relation then y=z.  Every function is a relation.  Every relation is not a function.

Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 71 Equivalence Relations  Since R is symmetric, a is equivalent to b whenever b is equivalent to a.  Since R is reflexive, every element is equivalent to itself.  Since R is transitive, if a and b are equivalent and b and c are equivalent, then a and c are equivalent.  Obviously, these three properties are necessary for a reasonable definition of equivalence. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 72 Equivalence Relations  Example: Suppose that R is the relation on the set of strings that consist of English letters such that aRb if and only if l(a) = l(b), where l(x) is the length of the string x. Is R an equivalence relation?  Solution:  R is reflexive, because l(a) = l(a) and therefore aRa for any string a.  R is symmetric, because if l(a) = l(b) then l(b) = l(a), so if aRb then bRa.  R is transitive, because if l(a) = l(b) and l(b) = l(c), then l(a) = l(c), so aRb and bRc implies aRc.  R is an equivalence relation. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 73 Partial Orderings  Sometimes, relations do not specify the equality of elements in a set, but define an order on them.  Definition: A relation R on a set S is called a partial ordering or partial order if it is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.  A set S together with a partial ordering R is called a partially ordered set, or poset, and is denoted by (S, R). Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 74 Partial Orderings  Example: Consider the “greater than or equal” relation  (defined by {(a, b) | a  b}).  Is  a partial ordering on the set of integers?   is reflexive, because a  a for every integer a.   is antisymmetric, because if a  b, then a  b  b  a is false.   is transitive, because if a  b and b  c, then a  c.  Consequently, (Z, ) is a partially ordered set. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 75 Partial Orderings  Another example: Is the “inclusion relation”  a partial ordering on the power set of a set S?   is reflexive, because A  A for every set A.   is antisymmetric, because if A  B, then A  B  B  A is false.   is transitive, because if A  B and B  C, then A  C.  Consequently, (P(S), ) is a partially ordered set.
