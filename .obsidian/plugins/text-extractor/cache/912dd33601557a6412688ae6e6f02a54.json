This is the meaning of disjunction. For p ∨ q to be true, either one or both of p and q must be true. • “Exclusive Or” - When reading the sentence “Soup or salad comes with this entrée,” we do not expect to be able to get both soup and salad. This is the meaning of Exclusive Or (Xor). In p ⊕ q , one of p and q must be true, but not both. The truth table for ⊕ is: p q P ⊕ q T T F T F T F T T F F F © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Implication If p and q are propositions, then p → q is a conditional statement or implication which is read as “if p, then q” and has this truth table: p q P → q T T T T F F F T T F F T Example: If p denotes “I am at home.” and q denotes “It is raining.” then p → q denotes “If I am at home then it is raining.” In p → q, p is the hypothesis (antecedent or premise) and q is the conclusion (or consequence). © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Understanding Implication 1 In p → q there does not need to be any connection between the hypothesis or the conclusion. The “meaning” of p → q depends only on the truth values of p and q. These implications are perfectly fine, but would not be used in ordinary English. • “If the moon is made of green cheese, then I have more money than Bill Gates. ” • “If the moon is made of green cheese then I’m on welfare.” • “If 1 + 1 = 3, then your grandma wears combat boots.” © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Understanding Implication 2 One way to view the logical conditional is to think of an obligation or contract. • “If I am elected, then I will lower taxes.” • “If you get 100% on the final, then you will get an A.” If the politician is elected and does not lower taxes, then the voters can say that he or she has broken the campaign pledge. Something similar holds for the professor. This corresponds to the case where p is true and q is false. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Different Ways of Expressing p → q if p, then q if p, q q unless ¬p q if p q whenever p q follows from p p implies q p only if q q when p p is sufficient for q q is necessary for p a necessary condition for p is q a sufficient condition for q is p © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse From p → q we can form new conditional statements . • q → p is the converse of p → q • ¬q → ¬p is the contrapositive of p → q • ¬p → ¬q is the inverse of p → q Example: Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of “It raining is a sufficient condition for my not going to town.” Solution: converse: If I do not go to town, then it is raining. contrapositive: If I go to town, then it is not raining. inverse: If it is not raining, then I will go to town. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Practice Problems Find the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of the following: • The home team wins whenever it is raining. • If the number is positive, then its square is positive. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Biconditional If p and q are propositions, then we can form the biconditional proposition p ↔ q, read as “p if and only if q .” The biconditional p ↔ q denotes the proposition with this truth table: p q P ↔ q T T T T F F F T F F F T If p denotes “I am at home.” and q denotes “It is raining.” then p ↔ q denotes “I am at home if and only if it is raining.” © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Expressing the Biconditional Some alternative ways “p if and only if q” is expressed in English: • p is necessary and sufficient for q • if p then q, and conversely • p iff q © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Practice Problem(s) Let p and q be the propositions p : I bought a lottery ticket this week. q : I won the million dollar jackpot.

Write these propositions using p and q and logical connectives (including negations). a) You do not drive over 65 miles per hour. b) You drive over 65 miles per hour, but you do not get a speeding ticket. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Practice Problem(s) (cont.) c) You will get a speeding ticket if you drive over 65 miles per hour. d) If you do not drive over 65 miles per hour, then you will not get a speeding ticket. e) Driving over 65 miles per hour is sufficient for getting a speeding ticket. f ) You get a speeding ticket, but you do not drive over 65 miles per hour. g) Whenever you get a speeding ticket, you are driving over 65 miles per hour. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Truth Tables For Compound Propositions Construction of a truth table: Rows • Need a row for every possible combination of values for the atomic propositions. Columns • Need a column for the compound proposition (usually at far right) • Need a column for the truth value of each expression that occurs in the compound proposition as it is built up. • This includes the atomic propositions © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Example Truth Table Construct a truth table for p ∨ q → ¬r p q r ¬r p ∨ q p ∨ q → ¬r T T T F T F T T F T T T T F T F T F T F F T T T F T T F T F F T F T T T F F T F F T F F F T F T © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Equivalent Propositions Two propositions are equivalent if they always have the same truth value.

If p or q then not r.( )p q r →  © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Example Problem: Translate the following sentence into propositional logic: “You can access the Internet from campus only if you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman.” Solution: Let a, c, and f represent respectively “You can access the internet from campus,” “You are a computer science major,” and “You are a freshman.” ( )a c f→   © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education System Specifications System and Software engineers take requirements in English and express them in a precise specification language based on logic. Example: Express in propositional logic: “The automated reply cannot be sent when the file system is full” Solution: One possible solution: Let p denote “The automated reply can be sent” and q denote “The file system is full.”qp→ © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Consistent System Specifications Definition: A list of propositions is consistent if it is possible to assign truth values to the proposition variables so that each proposition is true. Exercise: Are these specifications consistent? • “The diagnostic message is stored in the buffer or it is retransmitted.” • “The diagnostic message is not stored in the buffer.” • “If the diagnostic message is stored in the buffer, then it is retransmitted.” Solution: Let p denote “The diagnostic message is stored in the buffer.” Let q denote “The diagnostic message is retransmitted” The specification can be written as: p ∨ q, ¬p, p → q. When p is false and q is true all three statements are true. So the specification is consistent. • What if “The diagnostic message is not retransmitted” is added. Solution: Now we are adding ¬q and there is no satisfying assignment. So the specification is not consistent. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Logic Puzzles An island has two kinds of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You go to the island and meet A and B. • A says “B is a knight.” • B says “The two of us are of opposite types.” Example: What are the types of A and B? Solution: Let p and q be the statements that A is a knight and B is a knight, respectively. So, then ¬p represents the proposition that A is a knave and ¬q that B is a knave. • If A is a knight, then p is true. Since knights tell the truth, q must also be true. Then (p ∧ ¬ q) ∨ (¬ p ∧ q) would have to be true, but it is not. So, A is not a knight and therefore ¬p must be true. • If A is a knave, then B must not be a knight since knaves always lie. So, then both ¬p and ¬q hold since both are knaves.
