Example:  The department will award a free computer to either a CS student or a CS professor. How many different choices are there, if there are 530 students and 15 professors?  There are 530 + 15 = 545 choices. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 4 Basic Counting Principles Generalized sum rule:  If we have tasks T1, T2, …, Tm that can be done in n1, n2, …, nm ways, respectively, and no two of these tasks can be done at the same time, then there are n1 + n2 + … + nm ways to do one of these tasks. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 5 Basic Counting Principles The product rule:  Suppose that a procedure can be broken down into two successive tasks. If there are n1 ways to do the first task and n2 ways to do the second task after the first task has been done, then there are n1n2 ways to do the procedure. Generalized product rule:  If we have a procedure consisting of sequential tasks T1, T2, …, Tm that can be done in n1, n2, …, nm ways, respectively, then there are n1  n2  …  nm ways to carry out the procedure. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 6 Basic Counting Principles Example:  How many different license plates are there that contain exactly three English letters ? Solution:  There are 26 possibilities to pick the first letter, then 26 possibilities for the second one, and 26 for the last one.  So, there are 262626 = 17,576 different license plates. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 7 Basic Counting Principles  The sum and product rules can also be phrased in terms of set theory.  Sum rule: Let A1, A2, …, Am be disjoint sets. Then the number of ways to choose any element from one of these sets is |A1  A2  …  Am | = |A1| + |A2| + … + |Am|.  Product rule: Let A1, A2, …, Am be finite sets. Then the number of ways to choose one element from each set in the order A1, A2, …, Am is |A1  A2  …  Am | = |A1|  |A2|  …  |Am|. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 8 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle  How many bit strings of length 8 either start with a 1 or end with 00?  Task 1: Construct a string of length 8 that starts with a 1. There is one way to pick the first bit (1), two ways to pick the second bit (0 or 1), two ways to pick the third bit (0 or 1), . . . two ways to pick the eighth bit (0 or 1).  Product rule: Task 1 can be done in 127 = 128 ways. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 9 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle  Task 2: Construct a string of length 8 that ends with 00. There are two ways to pick the first bit (0 or 1), two ways to pick the second bit (0 or 1), . . . two ways to pick the sixth bit (0 or 1), one way to pick the seventh bit (0), and one way to pick the eighth bit (0).  Product rule: Task 2 can be done in 26 = 64 ways. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 10 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle  Since there are 128 ways to do Task 1 and 64 ways to do Task 2, does this mean that there are 192 bit strings either starting with 1 or ending with 00 ?  No, because here Task 1 and Task 2 can be done at the same time.  When we carry out Task 1 and create strings starting with 1, some of these strings end with 00.  Therefore, we sometimes do Tasks 1 and 2 at the same time, so the sum rule does not apply. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 11 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle  If we want to use the sum rule in such a case, we have to subtract the cases when Tasks 1 and 2 are done at the same time.  How many cases are there, that is, how many strings start with 1 and end with 00? There is one way to pick the first bit (1), two ways for the second, …, sixth bit (0 or 1), one way for the seventh, eighth bit (0).  Product rule: In 25 = 32 cases, Tasks 1 and 2 are carried out at the same time. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 12 Inclusion-Exclusion Principle  Since there are 128 ways to complete Task 1 and 64 ways to complete Task 2, and in 32 of these cases Tasks 1 and 2 are completed at the same time, there are  128 + 64 – 32 = 160 ways to do either task.  In set theory, this corresponds to sets A1 and A2 that are not disjoint. Then we have: |A1  A2| = |A1| + |A2| - |A1  A2|  This is called the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 13 Tree Diagrams  How many bit strings of length four do not have two consecutive 1s? 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 There are 8 strings. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 14 The Pigeonhole Principle  The pigeonhole principle: If (k + 1) or more objects are placed into k boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more of the objects.  Example 1: If there are 11 players in a soccer team that wins 12-0, there must be at least one player in the team who scored at least twice.  Example 2: If you have 6 classes from Monday to Friday, there must be at least one day on which you have at least two classes. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 15 The Pigeonhole Principle  The generalized pigeonhole principle: If N objects are placed into k boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least N/k of the objects.  Example 1: In a 60-student class, at least 12 students will get the same letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).  Example 2: In a 61-student class, at least 13 students will get the same letter grade. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 16 The Pigeonhole Principle  Example 3: Assume you have a drawer containing a random distribution of a dozen brown socks and a dozen black socks. It is dark, so how many socks do you have to pick to be sure that among them there is a matching pair?  There are two types of socks, so if you pick at least 3 socks, there must be either at least two brown socks or at least two black socks.  Generalized pigeonhole principle: 3/2 = 2. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 17 Permutations and Combinations  How many different sets of 3 people can we pick from a group of 6?  There are 6 choices for the first person, 5 for the second one, and 4 for the third one, so there are 654 = 120 ways to do this.  This is not the correct result!  For example, picking person C, then person A, and then person E leads to the same group as first picking E, then C, and then A.  However, these cases are counted separately in the above equation. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 18 Permutations and Combinations  So how can we compute how many different subsets of people can be picked (that is, we want to disregard the order of picking) ?  To find out about this, we need to look at permutations and combinations. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 19 Permutations and Combinations  A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of these objects.  An ordered arrangement of r elements of a set is called an r-permutation. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 20 Permutations and Combinations  Example: Let S = {1, 2, 3}. The arrangement 3, 1, 2 is a permutation of S. The arrangement 3, 2 is a 2-permutation of S.  The number of r-permutations of a set with n distinct elements is denoted by P(n, r).  We can calculate P(n, r) with the product rule: P(n, r) = n(n – 1)(n – 2) …(n – r + 1). (n choices for the first element, (n – 1) for the second one, (n – 2) for the third one…) Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 21 Permutations and Combinations  Example: P(8, 3) = 876 = 336 = (87654321)/(54321)  General formula: P(n, r) = n!/(n – r)! Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 22 Permutations and Combinations  An r-combination of elements of a set is an unordered selection of r elements from the set.  Thus, an r-combination is simply a subset of the set with r elements.  Example: Let S = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Then {1, 3, 4} is a 3-combination from S. The number of r-combinations of a set with n distinct elements is denoted by C(n, r).  Example: C(4, 2) = 6, since, for example, the 2-combinations of a set {1, 2, 3, 4} are {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 23 Permutations and Combinations  C(n, r) = n!/(r!(n – r)!)  Now we can answer our initial question: How many ways are there to pick a set of 3 people from a group of 6 (disregarding the order of picking)? C(6, 3) = 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(66) = 720/36 = 20 There are 20 different ways, that is, 20 different groups to be picked. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 24 Permutations and Combinations Corollary:  Let n and r be nonnegative integers with r  n. Then C(n, r) = C(n, n – r).  Note that “picking a group of r people from a group of n people” is the same as “splitting a group of n people into a group of r people and another group of (n – r) people”. Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 25 Permutations and Combinations  Example: A soccer club has 8 female and 7 male members. For today’s match, the coach wants to have 6 female and 5 male players on the grass. How many possible configurations are there? C(8, 6)  C(7, 5) = 8!/(6!2!)  7!/(5!2!) = 2821 = 588 Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 26 Combinations Pascal’s Identity:  Let n and k be positive integers with n  k. Then C(n + 1, k) = C(n, k – 1) + C(n, k). Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 27 Pascal’s Triangle  In Pascal’s triangle, each number is the sum of the numbers to its upper left and upper right: 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 … … … … … … Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 28 Pascal’s Triangle  Since we have C(n + 1, k) = C(n, k – 1) + C(n, k) and C(0, 0) = 1, we can use Pascal’s triangle to simplify the computation of C(n, k): C(0, 0) = 1 C(1, 0) = 1 C(1, 1) = 1 C(2, 0) = 1 C(2, 1) = 2 C(2, 2) = 1 C(3, 0) = 1 C(3, 1) = 3 C(3, 2) = 3 C(3, 3) = 1 C(4, 0) = 1 C(4, 1) = 4 C(4, 2) = 6 C(4, 3) = 4 C(4, 4) = 1 k n Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 29 Binomial Coefficients  Expressions of the form C(n, k) are also called binomial coefficients.  A binomial expression is the sum of two terms, such as (a + b). Consider (a + b)2 = (a + b)(a + b). When expanding such expressions, we have to form all possible products of a term in the first factor and a term in the second factor: (a + b)2 = a·a + a·b + b·a + b·b Then we can sum identical terms: (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 30 Binomial Coefficients  This leads us to the following formula: (𝑎 + 𝑏)𝑛 = ෍ 𝑗=0 𝑛 𝐶(𝑛, 𝑗) ⋅ 𝑎𝑛−𝑗 𝑏𝑗 With the help of Pascal’s triangle, this formula can considerably simplify the process of expanding powers of binomial expressions. For example, the fifth row of Pascal’s triangle (1 – 4 – 6 – 4 – 1) helps us to compute (a + b)4: (a + b)4 = a4 + 4a3b + 6a2b2 + 4ab3 + b4 (Binomial Theorem) Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 31 Summary  In this part, we discussed: ◼ Basic Counting Principles ◼ Inclusion-Exclusion Principle ◼ The Pigeonhole Principle ◼ Permutations and Combinations ◼ Pascal’s Triangle and Binomial Coefficients Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 32 References  These slides are largely based on the following two sources: ◼ Slides by Marc Pomplun, UMass Boston ◼ Official McGraw Hill’s Slides for our textbook Zia Ud Din CP214: Discrete Structures 33","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
