Yes No © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Introducing Predicate Logic Predicate logic is based Propositional functions. • A propositional function is a statement involving one or more variables, • e.g.: x-3 > 5. • Let us call this propositional function P(x), where P is the predicate and x is the variable. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Propositional Functions • Propositional functions become propositions when their variables are each replaced by a value from the domain • Domain is also called universe of discourse (U) • Let P(x) be “x-3 > 5” and U be all integers, What is the truth value of P(2) ? false What is the truth value of P(8) ? What is the truth value of P(9) ? false true © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Examples of Propositional Functions Let “x + y = z” be denoted by R(x, y, z) and U (for all three variables) be the integers. Find these truth values: R(2,-1,5) Solution: F R(3,4,7) Solution: T R(x, 3, z) Solution: Not a Proposition © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Examples of Propositional Functions Let “x - y = z” be denoted by Q(x, y, z), with U as the integers. Find these truth values: Q(2,-1,3) Solution: T Q(3,4,7) Solution: F Q(x, 3, z) Solution: Not a Proposition © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Compound Expressions Connectives from propositional logic carry over to predicate logic. If P(x) denotes “x > 0,” find these truth values: P(3) ∨ P(-1) P(3) ∧ P(-1) P(3) → P(-1) P(3) → ¬P(-1) Expressions with variables are not propositions and therefore do not have truth values. For example, P(3) ∧ P(y) P(x) → P(y) When used with quantifiers (to be introduced next), these expressions (propositional functions) become propositions. Solution: T Solution: F Solution: F Solution: T © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Quantifiers We need quantifiers to express the meaning of English words including all and some: • “All men are Mortal.” • “Some cats do not have fur.” The two most important quantifiers are: • Universal Quantifier, “For all,” symbol:  • Existential Quantifier, “There exists,” symbol:  We write as in x P(x) and x P(x). x P(x) asserts P(x) is true for every x in the domain. x P(x) asserts P(x) is true for some x in the domain. Charles Peirce (1839-1914) © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Universal Quantifier x P(x) is read as “For all x, P(x)” or “For every x, P(x)” Examples: 1) If P(x) denotes “x > 0” and U is the integers, then x P(x) is: false 2) If P(x) denotes “x > 0” and U is the positive integers, then x P(x) is: true 3) If P(x) denotes “x is even” and U is the integers, then  x P(x) is: false © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Existential Quantifier x P(x) is read as “For some x, P(x)”, or as “There is an x such that P(x),” or “For at least one x, P(x).” Examples: 1. If P(x) denotes “x > 0” and U is the integers, then x P(x) is: true 2. If P(x) denotes “x < 0” and U is the positive integers, then x P(x) is: false 3. If P(x) denotes “x is even” and U is the integers, then x P(x) is: true © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Precedence of Quantifiers The quantifiers  and  have higher precedence than all the logical operators. For example,x P(x)∨ Q(x) means (x P(x))∨ Q(x) x (P(x)∨ Q(x)) means something different. Unfortunately, often people writex P(x)∨ Q(x) when they mean x (P(x) ∨ Q(x)). © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Translating from English to Logic 1 Example 1: Translate the following sentence into predicate logic: “Every student in this class has taken a course in Java.” Solution: First decide on the domain U. Solution 1: If U is all students in this class, define a propositional function J(x) denoting “x has taken a course in Java” and translate asx J(x). Solution 2: But if U is all people, also define a propositional function S(x) denoting “x is a student in this class” and translate asx (S(x)→ J(x)). x (S(x) ∧ J(x)) is not correct. What does it mean? © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Translating from English to Logic 2 Example 2: Translate the following sentence into predicate logic: “Some student in this class has taken a course in Java.” Solution: First decide on the domain U. Solution 1: If U is all students in this class, translate as x J(x) Solution 2: But if U is all people, then translate as x (S(x) ∧ J(x)) x (S(x)→ J(x)) is not correct. What does it mean? © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Equivalences in Predicate Logic Statements involving predicates and quantifiers are logically equivalent if and only if they have the same truth value • for every predicate substituted into these statements and • for every domain of discourse used for the variables in the expressions. The notation S ≡T indicates that S and T are logically equivalent. Example: x ¬¬S(x) ≡x S(x) © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Negating Quantified Expressions 1 Considerx J(x) “Every student in your class has taken a course in Java.” Here J(x) is “x has taken a course in Java” and the domain is students in your class. Negating the original statement gives “It is not the case that every student in your class has taken Java.” This implies that “There is a student in your class who has not taken Java.” Symbolically¬x J(x) and x¬ J(x) are equivalent © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Negating Quantified Expressions 2 Now Consider  x J(x) “There is a student in this class who has taken a course in Java.” Where J(x) is “x has taken a course in Java.” Negating the original statement gives “It is not the case that there is a student in this class who has taken Java.” This implies that “Every student in this class has not taken Java” Symbolically¬ x J(x) and x ¬ J(x) are equivalent © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education De Morgan’s Laws for Quantifiers The rules for negating quantifiers are: TABLE 2 De Morgan’s Laws for Quantifiers. Negation Equivalent Statement When Is Negation True? When False? For every x, P(x) is false. There is x for which P(x) is true. There is an x for which P (x) is false. P(x) is true for every x. ¬∃𝑥𝑃 𝑥 ¬∀𝑥𝑃 𝑥 ∀𝑥¬𝑃 𝑥 ∃𝑥¬𝑃 𝑥 The reasoning in the table shows that: ¬∀𝑥𝑃 𝑥 ≡ ∃𝑥¬𝑃 𝑥 ¬∃𝑥𝑃 𝑥 ≡ ∀𝑥¬𝑃 𝑥 These are important.

Example: “Every real number has an inverse” is x y(x + y = 0) where the domains of x and y are the real numbers. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Order of Quantifiers Examples: 1. Let P(x,y) be the statement “x + y = y + x.” Assume that U is the real numbers. Then x yP(x,y) and y xP(x,y) have the same truth value. 2. Let Q(x,y) be the statement “x + y = 0.” Assume that U is the real numbers. Then x yQ(x,y) is true, but y xQ(x,y) is false. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Questions on Order of Quantifiers 1 Example 1: Let U be the real numbers, Define P(x,y) : x ∙ y = 0 What is the truth value of the following: ∀𝑥∀𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) ∀𝑥∃𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) ∃𝑥∀𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) ∃𝑥∃𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) Answer:False Answer:True Answer:True Answer:True © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Questions on Order of Quantifiers 2 Example 2: Let U be the real numbers, Define P(x,y) : x / y = 1 What is the truth value of the following: ∀𝑥∀𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) ∀𝑥∃𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) ∃𝑥∀𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) ∃𝑥∃𝑦𝑃(𝑥, 𝑦) Answer:False Answer:False Answer:False Answer:True © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Quantifications of Two Variables Statement When True? When False P(x,y) is true for every pair x,y. There is a pair x, y for which P(x,y) is false. For every x there is a y for which P(x,y) is true. There is an x such that P(x,y) is false for every y.

Solution: Every student in your school has a computer or has a friend who has a computer. Example 2: Translate the statement © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Translating English into Logical Expressions Example Example: Use quantifiers to express the statement “There is a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world.” Solution: 1. Let P(w,f) be “w has taken f ” and Q(f,a) be “f is a flight on a .” 2. The domain of w is all women, the domain of f is all flights, and the domain of a is all airlines. 3. Then the statement can be expressed as: ∃𝑤∀𝑎∃𝑓 𝑃 𝑤, 𝑓 ∧ 𝑄 𝑓, 𝑎 © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Questions on Translation from English Choose the obvious predicates and express in predicate logic. • Example 1: “Brothers are siblings.” • Solution: x y (B(x,y) → S(x,y)) • Example 2: “Siblinghood is symmetric.” • Solution: x y (S(x,y) → S(y,x)) • Example 3: “Everybody loves somebody.” • Solution: x y L(x,y) • Example 4: “There is someone who is loved by everyone.” • Solution: y x L(x,y) • Example 5: “There is someone who loves someone.” • Solution: x y L(x,y) • Example 6: “Everyone loves himself” • Solution: x L(x,x) © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Negating Nested Quantifiers Example: Recall the logical expression developed a few slides back: ∃𝑤∀𝑎∃𝑓 𝑃 𝑤, 𝑓 ∧ 𝑄 𝑓, 𝑎 Part 1: Use quantifiers to express the statement that “There does not exist a woman who has taken a flight on every airline in the world.” Solution: ¬∃𝑤∀𝑎∃𝑓 𝑃 𝑤, 𝑓 ∧ 𝑄 𝑓, 𝑎 Part 2: Now use De Morgan’s Laws to move the negation as far inwards as possible.

A proof consists of a sequence of statements that form an argument. • The steps that connect the statements in such a sequence are the rules of inference. • Cases of incorrect reasoning are called fallacies. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Terminology (cont.) • A theorem is a statement that can be shown to be true. • A lemma is a simple theorem used as an intermediate result in the proof of another theorem. • A corollary is a proposition that follows directly from a theorem that has been proved. • A conjecture is a statement whose truth value is unknown. Once it is proven, it becomes a theorem. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Arguments • Just like a rule of inference, an argument consists of one or more hypotheses and a conclusion. • We say that an argument is valid, if whenever all its hypotheses are true, its conclusion is also true. • However, if any hypothesis is false, even a valid argument can lead to an incorrect conclusion. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Arguments (Cont.) Example: “If 101 is divisible by 3, then 1012 is divisible by 9. 101 is divisible by 3. Consequently, 1012 is divisible by 9.” Although the argument is valid, its conclusion is incorrect, because one of the hypotheses is false (“101 is divisible by 3.”). If in the above argument we replace 101 with 102, we could correctly conclude that 1022 is divisible by 9. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Even and Odd Integers Definition: The integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k, and n is odd if there exists an integer k, such that n = 2k + 1. Note that every integer is either even or odd and no integer is both even and odd. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Proving Theorems Direct proof: An implication p→q can be proved by showing that if p is true, then q is also true. Example: Give a direct proof of the theorem “If n is odd, then n2 is odd.” Idea: Assume that the hypothesis of this implication is true (n is odd). Then use rules of inference and known theorems to show that q must also be true (n2 is odd). © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Direct Proof n is odd. Then n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer. Consequently, n2 = (2k + 1)2. = 4k2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1 Since n2 can be written in this form, it is odd. © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Indirect Proof Indirect proof: An implication p→q is equivalent to its contra-positive q → p. Therefore, we can prove p→q by showing that whenever q is false, then p is also false. Example: Give an indirect proof of the theorem “If 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd.” Idea: Assume that the conclusion of this implication is false (n is even). Then use rules of inference and known theorems to show that p must also be false (3n + 2 is even). © 2019 McGraw-Hill Education Indirect Proof (Cont.) n is even. Then n = 2k, where k is an integer. It follows that 3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1) Therefore, 3n + 2 is even. We have shown that the contrapositive of the implication is true, so the implication itself is also true (If 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd).","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":""}
