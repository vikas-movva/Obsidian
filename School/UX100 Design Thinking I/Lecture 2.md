### Design Thinking Process
- Empathize
	- This is the step where we take time to get to know our user
	- What is the problem/issues that the users are having 
	- Qualitative data
- Define
	- What is the **Problem** in **concrete** terms
	- What is the **exact problem** trying to be solved not the **solution**
- Ideate
	- Brainstorm some **ideas** that can solve the problem
- Prototype
	- A **minimal viable solution** to the problem
- Test
	- Test the prototype and go back to previous steps as needed
