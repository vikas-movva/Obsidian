Transitioning to university life is a pivotal and often challenging period for first-year students. As they embark on this new chapter, they encounter a range of difficulties that can impact both their academic performance and overall well-being. The academic rigor of university courses often exceeds that of high school, requiring students to adapt to new study techniques and manage their time more effectively. Additionally, the breadth and depth of new topics can be daunting, requiring students to develop a solid understanding quickly.

Beyond academics, the social aspect of university life presents its own set of challenges. Many first-year students move away from home for the first time, leaving behind familiar support systems and friendships. This relocation can lead to feelings of isolation and homesickness, further compounded by the pressure to form new social connections in an unfamiliar environment. For international students, these challenges are intensified by cultural and language barriers, making the adjustment even more strenuous.

Recognizing these multifaceted challenges, Wilfrid Laurier University has committed to creating an experience designed to support first-year students. The goal is to foster an environment that promotes academic success and social integration through the formation of study groups. Study groups can serve as a crucial support mechanism, providing students with the opportunity to collaborate on coursework, share knowledge, and build a sense of community. These groups can help students schedule regular study time, offer a platform for asking questions, and enable peer-to-peer learning, all of which are vital for academic success.

However, designing an effective study group experience requires a deep understanding of the needs and experiences of first-year students. It is essential to empathize with their unique challenges and identify what strategies work best for them. This involves comprehensive research to gather insights from the students themselves, as well as an analysis of existing literature and successful programs at other institutions.

The following sections outline a detailed research strategy to learn more about the users—first-year students at Wilfrid Laurier University. By conducting interviews, focus groups, and surveys, and by reviewing academic literature and university data, we aim to generate a thorough understanding of these students’ needs. This understanding will be articulated through an empathy map, two personas, and a journey map, providing a holistic view of the first-year student experience.

Ultimately, this research-driven approach will inform the design of a study group experience that not only enhances academic performance but also fosters social connections, helping first-year students navigate their university journey with confidence and support.
