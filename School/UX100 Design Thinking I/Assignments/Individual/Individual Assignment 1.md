## Research Strategy and User Experience Design for Newcomers to Ontario
## **Introduction**
Ontario, as one of Canada’s most diverse and economically vibrant provinces, has been actively encouraging immigrants to settle within its borders. The provincial government recognizes the significant contributions immigrants make to the workforce, cultural diversity, and economic growth. However, the transition to a new country presents numerous challenges for newcomers. They must navigate unfamiliar systems, establish social connections, secure employment, and ensure their families are comfortable and well-integrated into their new environment. To address these challenges, the Ontario government has initiated a project to develop a digital experience aimed at easing the transition for newcomers and providing them with the necessary resources for a successful settlement.

The primary goal of this initiative is to create a comprehensive digital platform that supports immigrants in various aspects of their new life in Ontario. This includes access to information on housing, employment, education, healthcare, and social services. To achieve this, it is essential to understand the unique needs and experiences of these newcomers. By developing empathy for their situations, the government can design a solution that truly addresses their challenges and supports their integration into Canadian society.

This document outlines a detailed research strategy to gather insights about the newcomers’ experiences and needs. The research will combine primary methods, such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups, with secondary methods, including literature reviews, analysis of existing services, and case studies. The findings from this research will be used to create an empathy map, two detailed personas, and a journey map. These tools will help visualize and communicate the newcomers’ experiences, ensuring that the digital platform is user-centric and effectively meets their needs. The ultimate aim is to facilitate a smoother transition for immigrants, helping them to thrive in their new home in Ontario.

## **Research Strategy Plan**
To create a meaningful digital experience for newcomers, a comprehensive research strategy is necessary to gain insights into their needs, challenges, and aspirations. This plan outlines the primary and secondary research methods that will be used to gather this information.

### **Primary Research**
1. **Interviews**
	- **Target Participants:** Recent immigrants, community leaders, social workers, and immigration consultants.
	- **Objective:** To gather personal stories, challenges, and specific needs from different perspectives.
	- **Method:** Conduct one-on-one interviews, either in-person or via video calls, focusing on their experiences before, during, and after moving to Ontario.
2. **Surveys**
	- **Target Participants:** A larger, diverse group of immigrants at different stages of their settlement process.
	- **Objective:** To collect quantitative data on common issues, resource utilization, and satisfaction levels.
	- **Method:** Distribute online surveys using platforms like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey, with questions covering areas such as housing, employment, education, healthcare, and social integration.

3. **Focus Groups**
	- **Target Participants:** Groups of newcomers from various cultural backgrounds and family compositions.
	- **Objective:** To encourage discussions that reveal common pain points and successful strategies among peers.
	- **Method:** Organize focus group sessions, either in-person or virtually, and facilitate guided discussions on specific topics relevant to their settlement experience.
	
### **Secondary Research**
1. **Literature Review**
	- **Sources:** Academic journals, government reports, and studies conducted by non-profit organizations.
	- **Objective:** To understand the broader context of immigrant experiences, including historical data, trends, and policy impacts.
	- **Method:** Review and summarize key findings from existing research on immigrant integration and challenges in Ontario.

2. **Analysis of Existing Services**
	- **Sources:** Websites and digital platforms of existing government and non-governmental services for newcomers.
	- **Objective:** To identify the strengths and weaknesses of current resources available to immigrants.
	- **Method:** Conduct a thorough analysis of available digital and physical services, assessing usability, accessibility, and content relevance.

3. **Case Studies**
	- **Sources:** Success stories and case studies from other regions or countries with effective newcomer integration programs.
	- **Objective:** To learn from successful initiatives and apply best practices to the Ontario context.
	- **Method:** Examine detailed accounts of effective integration strategies, focusing on their implementation and outcomes.

## **Combining Insights**
The data collected from primary and secondary research will be synthesized to identify common themes and critical issues. This comprehensive understanding will inform the development of the empathy map, personas, and journey map, ensuring they accurately reflect the experiences of newcomers.
