The hypothesis test
$H_{0}:\mu = 23$
$H_{1}:\mu \ne23$  

is to be carried out. A random sample is selected, and yields $\bar{x}=25$ and $s = 8$. If the value of the t statistic is $t=1.06066017177982$, what is the sample size? (If rounding is required, round to the nearest integer.)


Use the given data to find the 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean μ. Assume that the population has a normal distribution. (Provide your answer with at least three decimal places)

IQ scores of professional athletes:  
Sample size $n=25$

**A.** Raise the sample size to the power 4.  
**B.** Square the sample size.

From previous studies, it has been generally believed that Northern Hemisphere icebergs have a mean depth of 270 meters. An environmentalist has suggested that global warming has caused icebergs to have greater depth. A team of scientists visiting the Northern Hemisphere observed a random sample of 41 icebergs. The depth of the base of the iceberg below the surface was carefully measured for each. The sample mean and standard deviation were calculated to be 276 meters and 20 meters respectively.

**B.** 41  
**C.** The mean depth (in m) of all Northern Hemisphere icebergs.  
**D.** 270 meters  
**E.** None of the above

The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs is 270 meters now.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs is greater than 270 meters now.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs is smaller than 270 meters now.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs is different from 270 meters now.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs used to be 270 meters.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs used to be greater than 270 meters.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs used to be smaller than 270 meters.  
The mean depth of the Northern Hemisphere icebergs used to be different from 270 meters.

Select True or False depending on whether the corresponding statement is true or false.  

**1.** Tests in which samples are not independent are referred to as matched pairs.

**3.** Independent samples are those for which the selection process for one is not related to the selection process for the other.
**4.** The pooled variances t−test requires that the two population variances are not the same.

A noted psychic was tested for ESP. The psychic was presented with 240 cards face down and was asked to determine if the card was one of 5 symbols: a star, cross, circle, square, or three wavy lines. The psychic was correct in 65 cases. Let p represent the probability that the psychic correctly identifies the symbol on the card in a random trial. Assume the 240 trials can be treated as an SRS from the population of all guesses.  
To see if there is evidence that the psychic is doing better than just guessing, we test

Moonbucks, a popular coffee chain, is interested in opening a new store on WLU campus. After reading McBeans' article, they will consider opening a store in WLU if more than 80% of the people in WLU drink coffee regularly.
