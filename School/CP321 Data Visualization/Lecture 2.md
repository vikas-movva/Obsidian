### Cognitive Load theory
- Memory is comprised of two primary structures: long term and short term
- the aim of instruction is to alter long-term memory however information must first pass through short-term memory
- short term memory can hold ~7 items which is lost within 20seconds without review.
- In data visualization it is important to ==present information in a comprehensible manner== and ==make use of CLT to present info in a way that people can digest==

---
### Multiple Representation / Multimedia
- different types of info (words, images, videos) are relatively independent to absorb
- the Multiple-channel learning principle says that 
	1. *Multimedia principle:* People learn better form words and pictures than from words alone
	2. *Split attention principle:* it is important to avoid formats that require learners to split their attention between, and mentally integrate, multiple sources of info
	3. *Modality principle:* People learn better from graphics and narration than from graphics and text
	4. *Redundancy principle:* People learn better when important information is given multiple times in different forms (text & spoken)
	5. *Spacial contiguity principle:* learning is improved when words and pictures that are related to each other are physically close on the page
	6. *Temporal contiguity principle:* learning is improved when words and pictures that are related to each other are presented at the same time
	7. *Coherence Principle:* People learn more deeply from multimedia message when extraneous material is excluded (==Don't information overload==)
	8. *Signalling Principle:* People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when cues are added that highlight the critical aspects of presented information (Headings, ==highlights==, ***emphasis*** )
	9. *Personalization Principle:* People learn more deeply when the words in a multimedia presentation are in conversational style rather than formal style (use **We** or **You** as if talking directly to the reader)
	10. *Pre-training Principle:* People learn more deeply from a multimedia message when they know the names and characteristics of the main concepts

### Models for Information Visualization
- Theoretical models
	- Abstraction
	- Continua
	- Cognitive Load Theory and Multimedia Principles
- Descriptive models
- Prescriptive models
	- these models seek to provide support in the creation, understanding, and evaluation of visualizations.
		- Shneiderman's Visual Information-Seeking Mantra
			- a framework for designing effective visualizations that help users make sense of large amounts of data. The mantra consists of three steps: **overview first**, **zoom and filter**, and **details-on-demand**
		- Van Ham and Perer's Search and Expand
			- Van Ham and Perer’s Search and Expand is an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. The model is designed to support large graph exploration with degree-of-interest
		- Chi’s Data State Reference: analytical abstraction, visualization abstraction, and the view
			-   **Analytical Abstraction**: The process of transforming raw data into a structured and meaningful format.
			-   **Visualization Abstraction**: The process of creating a visual representation from either non-visual or visual data.
			-   **The View**: The final visual representation of data in a data visualization system.
		- Fry’s Acquire, Parse, Filter, Mine, Represent, and Interact
			- **Acquire**: The process of collecting data from various sources.
			- **Parse**: The process of structuring raw data in a meaningful way.
			- **Filter**: The process of removing unnecessary data.
			- **Mine**: The process of analyzing data to discover patterns or relationships.
			- **Represent**: The process of visualizing data in a comprehensible manner.
			- **Interact**: The process of manipulating the data representation to gain further insights.
		- The ASSERT model
			- Support the creation of visualizations that are accessible, insightful, educational, compelling
			- include the complete developmental life cycle of visualizations
