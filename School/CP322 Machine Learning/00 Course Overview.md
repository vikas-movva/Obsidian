Welcome to CP322 Machine Learning! In this exciting and comprehensive journey, we will explore the fascinating world of machine learning and delve into the cutting-edge realm of deep learning. This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in both traditional machine learning approaches and the latest advancements in deep learning techniques.

# Course Overview

Machine learning has revolutionized the way we solve complex problems, make predictions, and uncover hidden patterns in vast datasets. In this course, we will cover the four major approaches to machine learning, which are information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. These fundamental techniques form the basis for various machine learning models and algorithms.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of deep learning, which has sparked a paradigm shift in the field of artificial intelligence. Deep learning models, inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain, have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. 

### Course Format

The course is conducted in a classroom setting. Lectures are scheduled to commence on September 9th, 2024.

### Prerequisites
- Prerequisite courses: Successful completion of CP312.
- Knowledge of basic computer science principles and skills, at a level comfortable with writing a non-trivial computer program. 
- Good knowledge of Python. We will give programming assignments and course project. You will need to be familiar with Python, and we will not cover programming-specific issues in this course.
- Familiarity with basic probability theory, basic linear algebra, statistical and algorithmic analysis.

### Marking Scheme

| Assesment          | % of Final Grade |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Assignment         | 30%              |
| Team-based Project | 20%              |
| Midterm exam       | 30%              |
| Quizzes            | 20%              |


_Please note:_
- During the course, there are three individual homework assignments to complete. Submit these in a notebook format with a `.ipynb` extension. You'll need to use Python and libraries like `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `Pytorch`, and Hugging Face. For ease of use, installing Anaconda on your computer is recommended. Alternatively, Colab can be used, just make sure to save your work in the `.ipynb` format.
- There is one 80-minute in-class exam scheduled. Students are expected to bring their own laptop and take the exam through MyLS.
- You'll take 9 online quizzes. Only your top 8 scores will count towards your final grade. No make-up quizzes or extensions are available. While you won't need the Respondus Monitor for online quizzes and exams, you will still need to use the Respondus Lockdown Browser.
- Extensions for assignments and projects are only granted for medical reasons with a doctor's note. Assignments or projects submitted within 48 hours after the deadline will have their grade reduced by 50%. Submissions beyond 48 hours post-deadline cannot be accepted and will receive a grade of 0. Requests to adjust marks to improve the final grade will not be entertained.

**The schedule is subject to adjustment based on the class's progress.**

Throughout the academic year, it is important to plan ahead and pay attention to [Important Dates and Deadlines on the University Calendar](https://students.wlu.ca/academics/calendars-and-policies/important-dates-and-deadlines.html). Take note of important dates such as reading week, exam periods, statutory holidays as well as administrative deadlines such as course drop dates and tuition due dates. We will also post important deadlines of evaluation components of this course in MyLS.

### Academic Integrity

It is expected that all students will follow assignment instructions and will adhere to Laurier’s regulations with respect to [Academic Integrity](https://students.wlu.ca/academics/academic-integrity/index.html). As a Laurier student, you are responsible for familiarizing yourself with this policy and the accompanying penalty guidelines, some of which may appear on your transcript if there is a finding of misconduct.

**Ignorance of Laurier’s academic misconduct policy is not a defense**

The following, but not limited to, are violations of [Laurier’s Academic Code of Conduct:](https://www.wlu.ca/about/governance/assets/resources/12.2-student-code-of-conduct.html)

1. Accessing unauthorized resources (Google, chat rooms, Chegg, Reddit, etc.) for assessments.
2. Using technological aids beyond what is listed as permitted in an assessment.
3. Posting test, assignment, lab or exam questions to message boards, social media, or other unauthorized websites (ex. Chegg or CourseHero). While these third parties claim to be tutoring resources, for a fee they take your work and share it with other students; an act that constitutes an action of academic misconduct. 
4. Copying the work of others by way of file or image sharing.
5. Posting test, assignment, lab or exam questions and answers in virtual "course groups" (ex. Facebook, Discord or WhatsApp).
6. Copying the work that is shared or posted in virtual "course groups" (ex. Facebook, Discord or WhatsApp).
7. Working collaboratively with others on assessments that are expected to be completed individually.
8. Copying the work of others by writing down answers that they tell you, but that you did not independently determine.
9. Backdating emails to gain more time to complete assessments.

**Generative AI**

**The use of generative AI is permitted in specific components of this course.** Due to the nature of this course, which focuses on machine learning, we will introduce and explore generative AI models and algorithms as part of the curriculum. However, the use of generative AI will be specifically limited to the final chapter on "Deep Learning." In all submissions in which you use generative AI, you must [cite its usage](https://library.wlu.ca/ai). Failing to cite the use of generative AI is academic misconduct. In all other aspects of your work, the use of generative AI will be considered academic misconduct and Senate Policy 12.2 Student Code of Conduct: Academic Misconduct will be applied.  
  

### University and Course Policies

1. **Academic Calendars:** Students are encouraged to review the [Academic Calendar](https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/) for information regarding all important dates, deadlines, and services available on campus.

2. **Accessibility**: Contact [Accessible Learning](https://lauriercloud.sharepoint.com/sites/student-affairs/academic-supports/accessible-learning/Pages/default.aspx) if you require academic accommodations because of a disability.  Review the [Registration](https://students.wlu.ca/academics/support-and-advising/accessible-learning/registration/index.html) page for information about intake and documentation requirements.   Deadlines: Students are responsible for meeting posted deadlines for registering with Accessible Learning and booking accommodated exams.  Accessible Learning cannot guarantee accommodations for requests received after posted deadlines.

3. **Library Accessibility Service:** The Library offers accessibility services for people with disabilities, including alternate formats or remediation of Library collections and help accessing materials. For information please visit the Library Accessibility Hub ([library.wlu.ca/services/accessibility-hub](https://library.wlu.ca/services/accessibility-hub)) or email [libaccessibility@wlu.ca](mailto:libaccessibility@wlu.ca).

4. **Plagiarism:** Wilfrid Laurier University uses software that can check for plagiarism. If requested to do so by course instructors, students are required to submit their written work in electronic form and have it checked for plagiarism (Approved by Senate May 14, 2002).

5. **Final Examinations:** Students are strongly urged not to make any commitments (e.g., vacation) during the examination period. Students are required to be available for examinations during the examination periods of all terms in which they register.
