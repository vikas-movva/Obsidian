**Ya hemos pasao** (Spanish) - 2:30-6:10
Era en aquel Madrid de hace dos años,  
donde mandaban Prieto y don Lenin.  
Era en aquel Madrid de la cochambre, de Largo Caballero y de Negrín.  
Era en aquel Madrid de milicianos, de hoces y de martillos, y soviet.  
Era en aquel Madrid de puño en alto, donde gritaban ¡No pasarán!.  
¡No pasarán! decían los marxistas.  
¡No pasarán! gritaban por las calles.  
¡No pasarán!, se oía a todas horas por plazas y plazuelas con voces miserables.  
¡No pasarán!  
¡Ya hemos pasao!, .... y estamos en las Cavas.  
¡Ya hemos pasao! con alma y corazón.  
¡Ya hemos pasao! y estamos esperando pá ver caer la porra de la Gobernación.  
¡Ya hemos pasao!  
Este Madrid es hoy de yugo y flechas;  
es sonriente, alegre y juvenil.  
Este Madrid es hoy brazos en alto, sin signos de flaqueza, cual nuevo Abril.  
Este Madrid es hoy de la Falange, siempre garboso y lleno de cuplés.  
A este Madrid que cree en la Paloma, muy de Delicias, y de Chamberí.  
¡Ya hemos pasao!, decimos los facciosos.  
¡Ya hemos pasao!, gritamos los rebeldes.  
¡Ya hemos pasao!, y estamos en el Prado, mirando frente a frente a la señá Cibeles.  
¡Ya hemos pasao!  
¡No pasarán!; la burla cruel y el reto.  
¡No pasarán!; pasquín en las paredes.  
¡No pasarán!, gritaban por el micro, chillaban en la prensa y en todos los papeles.  
¡No pasarán!  
Ja, ja, ja, ja  
¡Ya hemos pasao!.

**Ya hemos pasao** (English)
It was in that Madrid of two years ago,  
where Prieto and Don Lenin ruled.  
It was in that Madrid of filth,  
of Largo Caballero and Negrín.  
It was in that Madrid of militiamen, of sickles and hammers, and the Soviets.  
It was in that Madrid of raised fists, where they shouted "They shall not pass!”  
"They shall not pass!" said the Marxists.  
"They shall not pass!" they shouted in the streets.  
"They shall not pass!" could be heard at all hours in the squares and plazas with  
miserable voices.  
"They shall not pass!”  
"We have already passed!" .... and we are in the Cavas.  
"We have already passed!" with heart and soul.  
"We have already passed!" and we are waiting to see the Governor's baton fall.  
"We have already passed!”  
This Madrid today is of yoke and arrows;  
it is smiling, joyful, and youthful.  
This Madrid today is arms raised, without signs of weakness, like the new April.  
This Madrid today belongs to the Falange, always graceful and full of couplets.  
To this Madrid that believes in the Dove, very much of Delicias, and of Chamberí.  
We've already passed! we, the factious, say.  
We've already passed! we, the rebels, shout.  
We've already passed! And we're in the Prado, staring face to face at Lady Cibeles.  
We've already passed!  
They shall not pass! The cruel mockery and the challenge.  
They shall not pass! A poster on the walls.  
They shall not pass! They shouted into the microphone,  
they screamed in the press and in every newspaper.  
They shall not pass!  
Ha, ha, ha, ha  
We've already passed!


Celia Gámez's "Ya hemos pasao" provides listeners with the victors' viewpoint on post-Spanish Civil War Spain. The lyrics achieve this by contrasting Madrid before and after the conflict, employing political representations to symbolize the shift in power and ideology. This can be seen in the initial verses which convey a negative picture of Republican-held Madrid as it associats it with specific leftist leaders by utilizing imagery like the hammer and sickle and the raised fist to evoke the socialist and communist influences of the time. By portraying Republican Madrid as a place of 'cochambre' and 'miserable voices,' the song establishes a negative atmosphere designed to share a positive transformation under Nationalist rule. The shift to 'Este Madrid,' symbolized by the 'yugo y flechas,' presents an idealized image of a 'sonriente, alegre y juvenil' city, effectively emhancingg the importance of the Nationalist takeover as a liberation and their fresh start. Moreover, the themes of the song express the establishment of the narrative of the victor. This is shown with the use of symbols and slogans to define the political power and the reshaping of Madrid's identity to align with Nationalist ideology. Finally, in order to signify the meaning behind the song, it acts as a powerful piece of cultural propaganda, reinforcing the Nationalist victory and promoting an image of a revitalized Spain under their control through its stark contrast with a negatively portrayed Republican past.


The lyrics of "Ya hemos pasao" by Celia Gámez conveys a vivid contrast between the Republican-controlled Madrid during the Spanish Civil War and the Nationalist-controlled Madrid after their victory. The initial stanzas depict the Republican era, characterized by the names of prominent leftist leaders (Prieto, Largo Caballero, Negrín, Lenin), the presence of militiamen, and the symbolic imagery of the hammer and sickle, and the raised fist. The recurring slogan "¡No pasarán!" (They shall not pass!), was a famous Republican rallying cry during the Siege of Madrid. It is highlighted as a ubiquitous expression of defiance heard throughout the city.

The lyrics then shift to describe the Madrid under Nationalist control ("Este Madrid es hoy de yugo y flechas"), referencing the symbols of the Falangist movement. This new Madrid is portrayed as "sonriente, alegre y juvenil," a starkly different image from the "cochambre" (filth) and "voces miserables" (miserable voices) associated with the Republican period. The phrase "brazos en alto" further emphasizes the Nationalist presence, as it was their characteristic salute. Through this juxtaposition, the song underscores the dramatic shift in power and ideology that occurred in Madrid as the war progressed and concluded. The title itself, "Ya hemos pasao" ("We have already passed" or "We have overcome"), suggests a sense of triumph and the finality of the Nationalist victory over the Republican forces in the capital.
