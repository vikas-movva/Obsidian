Create a Software Design Document (SDD) for a software with the following requirements:
#### Project requirements  
1. Design and develop a software application to read two text files and format the data  
output to a new file (Note: the format of input file and output file is described in  
Appendix A). The design should contain both architecture design and detailed design.  
2. The software must use at least two of the following Object-Oriented programming  
features.  
(1) Inheritance, (2) Polymorphism, (3) Encapsulation, (4) Abstraction  
3. The project requires to use one of compile languages such as C++, C#, and Java (not  
scripting languages like Python, JavaScript, PHP etc.). Please refer to Appendix B for  
APIs of C++ and Java  
4. The software must be reliable. Your group should apply “offensive programming”  
technique which we will learn in this course.  
5. The output file must be sorted by using the student ID.  

The report should contain both architecture design and detailed design.

Make any diagrams with mermaid.js

| Main idea    | Clearly presents a main idea and supports it throughout the paper.                                                                                                 | There is a main idea supported throughout most of the paper.                                                                         | Vague sense of a main idea, weakly supported throughout the paper.                         | A little main idea                                                                               |
| Organization | Well-planned and well-thought out. Includes title, introduction and conclusion. All paragraphs have clear ideas.                                                   | Good overall organization, includes title. Most paragraphs have clear ideas.                                                         | There is a sense of organization. Some paragraphs have clear ideas.                        | There is somewhat organization. Some paragraphs have ideas                                       |
| Content      | Exceptionally well- presented and argued; ideas are detailed, well- developed, supported with specific evidence & facts, as well as examples and specific details. | Well-presented and argued; ideas are detailed, developed and supported with evidence and details, mostly specific.                   | Content is sound and solid; ideas are present but not particularly developed or supported. | Content is fair, but not well developed. Or Content is not sound.                                |
| Reference    | Sources are exceptionally well- integrated and they support claims argued in the report very effectively. Quotations and works cited conform to APA style.         | Sources are integrated and support the claims. There may be occasional errors, but the sources and works cited conform to APA style. | Sources are not integrated well. They are not cited correctly according to APA style       | The report does not use adequate reference. They are not cited correctly according to APA style. |

Create the software outlined the the Software Design Document.
