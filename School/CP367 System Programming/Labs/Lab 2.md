1. When using `ls -la`, the output is structured as follows:
    
    - The **first character** on the line indicates the type of the file. A `-` represents a regular file, `d` represents a directory, and `l` represents a symbolic link.
    - The **next nine characters** represent the file permissions for the owner, group, and others respectively. Each set of three characters indicates read (`r`), write (`w`), and execute (`x`) permissions.
    - The **numbers in the sixth column** represent the size of the file in bytes.
    - The entries `.` and `..` represent the current directory and the parent directory respectively.
2. Here’s what the following commands do and their basic syntax:
    
    - `cd`: Changes the current directory. Syntax: `cd [directory]`. If no directory is specified, it changes to the home directory.
    - `rm`: Removes files or directories. Syntax: `rm [option]... [file]...`. By default, it does not remove directories.
    - `mkdir`: Creates a new directory. Syntax: `mkdir [option]... [directory]...`.
    - `rmdir`: Removes empty directories. Syntax: `rmdir [option]... [directory]...`.
    - `head`: Outputs the first part of files. Syntax: `head [option]... [file]...`. By default, it prints the first 10 lines of each file to standard output.
    - `tail`: Outputs the last part of files. Syntax: `tail [option]... [file]...`. By default, it prints the last 10 lines of each file to standard output.
