Students are invited to propose their own project or work in a group with no more than three members. Once a proposed project is approved, no requests to change group members or switch to individual work will be accepted. All group members will receive the same grade, so please ensure that the workload is distributed fairly and that everyone contributes equally. If you choose to work as a team on the project, only one team member needs to submit the project form, report, and any other related materials. The project may encompass one or more of the following areas: 
1. A critical review of a significant article (e.g., from journal papers or magazines).
2. An evaluation of two methods proposed in different papers. 
3. Further development or analysis of an existing approach or idea. 
4. A novel approach, technique, analysis, or algorithm. Each project must include a literature review from at least one journal or magazine article. Recommended journals and magazines include: • IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security • IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing • IEEE Security and Privacy • Springer Journal of Cryptology • ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security • USENIX Conferences • ACM CSS It is advisable to consult the materials listed in the references of your selected paper to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic of interest. Additionally, utilize the bibliographical notes and references provided in the textbook for further materials. Sample topics may include: • Security aspects of IoT devices or networks • Authentication and data integrity methods in 5G or 6G networks • Comparative analysis of stream and block ciphers • Concepts and techniques of group-key or session key management • Digital or crypto cash systems • Secure web-based purchase orders • Virtual election booths, etc. Report Guidelines The final report constitutes 30 percent of the final grade. The report should not exceed 10-20 pages, including figures and references. It should be neat, readable, and self-contained, written with the potential readership in mind. Every class member should be able to understand and derive benefits from the results obtained in your report. Therefore, you must include adequate references and/or background materials. Utilize tables, diagrams, graphs, figures, and excerpts of printouts to enhance the comprehension of your project by the readers. Suggested Report Format The following structure is recommended for your report. While adherence to this format is not mandatory, and modifications may be required based on the specifics of your project, it is imperative that you type and paginate your report. The sections suggested are as follows: 1. Abstract: This section should be positioned at the beginning of your report but written last. It should provide a concise summary of your project, including the purpose, methods used, main findings, and conclusions. 2. Introduction: This should include relevant background material and a literature review. Discuss the scope of your project and any limitations you have identified. 3. Discussion: This constitutes the main body of your report and should detail the methodology you employed. Be thorough in describing any figures, tables, or diagrams used, ensuring they are fully explained within the text. 4. Results: Present the findings of your project here, clearly and systematically. 5. Conclusions: Summarize the implications of your results and what they contribute to the field. 6. Recommendations: Offer suggestions for future work and outline any problems that remain unresolved. 7. References: This section is mandatory and should comply with either the American Psychological Association (APA) or IEEE citation styles. For more detailed guidelines, visit APA and IEEE Citation Styles. 8. Appendices: Include any supporting material that is relevant but not essential to the main text of your report.
