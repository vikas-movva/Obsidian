### Definitions

### Data Models
A set of concepts to describe the structure of a DB, the operations for manipulating these structure, and certain constraints that the database should obey
- #defn Structure
	- Constructs are used to define the database structure
	- Constructs typically include elements as well as groups of elements
- #defn Constraints
	- specify some restrictions on valid data; these constraints must be enforced at all times
- #defn Operations
	- are used for specifying database retrievals and updates by referring to the constructs of the data model.
	- Operations on the data model may include **basic model operations**(insert, delete, update) and **user-defined operations**(custom functions)
#### Categories
- Conceptual (high-level, semantic)
	- provide concepts that are close to the way many users perceive data
		- entity-based or object based data models
- Physical (low-level, internal)
	- Provide concepts that describe details of how data is stored in the computer. These are usually specified in a temporary manner through DBMS design and administration manuals
- Implementation (representational)
	- Provide concepts that fall between the above two, used by many commercial DBMS implementations
- Self-Describing
	- Combine the description of data with the data values. examples include XML, key-value stores and some NoSQL systems
