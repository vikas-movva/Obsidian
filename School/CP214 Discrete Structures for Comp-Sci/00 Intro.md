### The Course
- Discrete math is the part of math devoted to the study of [[discrete objects]]
- topics that will be discussed
	- Mathematical theory of discrete math
	- applications in comp-sci
	- applications in real life

### Course Goals
- Mathematical reasoning
	- ability to read, understand, and construct mathematical arguments and proofs
- Combinatorial analysis
	- techniques for counting objects of different kinds
- Discrete structures
	- abstract mathematical structures that represent objects and the relationships between them. (sets, permutations, relations, graphs, trees)
- Applications and modelling
- use discrete structures to address problems in computing and other areas
