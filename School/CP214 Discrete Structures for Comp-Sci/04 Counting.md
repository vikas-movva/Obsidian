### Basic Counting Principles
- Counting problems are of the following kind
	- ==how many== **different** 8-letter passwords are there?
	- ==how many== possible ways are there to pick 11 soccer players out of a 20 player team
- Counting is also the basis for computing ==Probabilities of discrete events==
	- "What is the probability of winning the lottery"
- The sum rule
	- if a task can be done in $n_1$, ways and a second task in $n_2$ ways, and if these two tasks cannot be done at the same time, then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do either task
	- Ex.
		- the department will award a free computer to either a CS student or a CS professor. How many different choices are there, if there are 530 students and 15 professors
			- there are $530 + 15 = 545$ choices
- The Product rule
	- if a procedure can be broken down into two separate tasks and there are $n_1$ ways to do the first and $n_2$ ways to do the second ==after the first task has been done== there are $n_1 n_2$ ways to do the procedure
