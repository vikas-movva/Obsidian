### Sets
- a set is an unordered collection of objects
- ### Symbols
	- $a \in A$ - a is an element of A
	- $a \notin A$ - a is not an element of A
	- $A = \{a_1, a_2, ...\}$ - A contains
	- the order of elements is meaningless
	- it does not matter how often the same element is listed
- ### Set equality
	- Sets A and B are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements
		- EX. $A = \{9,2,4\}, B=\{2,4,9\}$ $\therefore A=B$  
- ### Examples of Sets
	- $A = \emptyset = \{\}$ 
	- $A = \{\{x,y\}\}$ 
		- Note $\{x,y\} \in A$ but $\{x,y\} \neq \{\{x,y\}\}$
