- **Obstacles (Step 1):**  
    You already listed _managing textbook readings_ and _feeling stressed & overwhelmed_. Can you give me 3–4 more specific obstacles you faced academically and personally last semester? (e.g., procrastination, balancing work and study, poor sleep, distraction, test anxiety, etc.)
    - procrastination
    - poor sleep
    - test anxiety
    
- **Top 3 Obstacles (Step 2):**  
    Out of all your obstacles, which three had the biggest negative impact on your academic performance?
    - procrastination
    - poor sleep
    
- **Workable Solutions (Step 3):**  
    Which specific strategies or habits do you feel most willing and able to commit to? For example, tutoring, structured study blocks, reducing work hours, wellness counseling, peer study groups, using academic resources like the writing centre, etc.
    - structured study blocks
    - wellness counseling
    - peer study groups
    
- **SMART Goal (Step 4):**  
    If you had to focus on _one main solution_ for this semester, what is the single most important change you want to achieve? (e.g., submit all assignments on time, reduce procrastination, manage stress, improve grades to a specific GPA, etc.)
    - reduce procrastination
    
- **Barriers (Step 5):**  
    Besides your weekend work hours (already noted), what other barriers could interfere with your SMART goal? (e.g., lack of motivation, distractions, time mismanagement, mental health, unexpected personal issues.)
    - lack of motivation
    - mental health
    - time mismanagement
    
- **Celebrations (Step 6):**  
    What short-term rewards actually motivate you? (e.g., gaming, hanging out with friends, small purchases, taking a day trip, etc.) And what’s a “big reward” you’d feel proud to give yourself at the end if you achieve your main goal?
    Short-term rewards:
    - hanging out with friends
    - playing volleyball
	Big reward:
	- Going to a concert
    
- **Summary (Step 7):**  
    The rubric wants a **500–600 word reflection**. To personalize it, I’ll need:
    
    - Why you’re in the SAS program (what academic challenges led you here).
	    - due to poor mental health i accumulated a lot of f grades in my first couple years at university, in the winter 2025 semester i bit more than i could chew and took 6 courses while also working as a software developer part time. this led to me missing assignments in CP414 eventually leading to me failing the course and over the 10 F grade limit.
        
    - How you believe SAS resources will support you.
	    - I believe that the sas resources will help me mitigate some of the obstacles that i regularly face (ex. mental health, procrastination, time management)
        
    - What motivates you to succeed in school (future career, personal reasons, family, etc.).
	    - I am motivated by my future career and the personal freedom that the income i gain through that.
        
- **Assessment Schedule (Step 8):**  
    Can you give me the due dates for your **SAS 001 assignments** and your **elective course assignments** this semester? If you don’t have exact dates, approximate weeks are fine—I can build a detailed timeline and action plan from that.
