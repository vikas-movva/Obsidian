### The Course
- Introduces you to the concept of _medievalism_ (briefly, how popular culture uses the Middle Ages as subject matter and/or inspiration and utilizes the “medieval” as a way of reflecting on their own society).
- The world of Harry Potter will be the entry into this complicated relationship and through examining themes found in J.K. Rowling’s text we will chart a course through its influences, both medieval and modern.

### Course Goals
- The influence of medieval literary forms on the narrative of the Harry Potter novels
- J.K. Rowling’s use of medieval ideas of magic, medicine, and prophecy
- Visual medievalism in the architecture of the Harry Potter universe
- Parallels with key aspects of medieval culture (including chivalry and knighthood, the medieval university, medieval feasting, and medieval book culture).
- Participatory and experiential medievalisms in Harry Potter tourism, merchandise, and fan cultures.
