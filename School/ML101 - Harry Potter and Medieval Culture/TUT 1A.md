### Prompt #4
- Write a 600 word response on what are some of the differences between medieval knights and the ideal of Chivalry found in Harry Potter and elaborate on them. Include detailed examples of each difference.

In Harry Potter, the ideal of chivalry is represented by the character of Sirius Black. Sirius is a pure-blood wizard who is fiercely loyal to his friends and family. He is also brave and courageous, always ready to face danger. Sirius is the embodiment of the chivalrous knight who puts others before himself.

In contrast, the medieval knights were often more concerned with their own personal glory and advancement. They were also often brutal and ruthless in battle, showing little mercy to their enemies. While they may have been brave, they were not always honorable.

One of the biggest differences between Sirius and the medieval knights is their code of honor. Sirius always tries to act in a honorable way, even if it means putting himself at risk. He is always truthful and loyal to his friends. In contrast, the medieval knights often had a code of honor that was based more on their personal gain and glory. They were often dishonest and disloyal, betraying their friends and family for their own gain.

Another difference between Sirius and the medieval knights is their attitude towards violence. Sirius is always reluctant to resort to violence, even when it is necessary. He only uses force as a last resort. In contrast, the medieval knights often used violence as a first resort. They were quick to resort to force, and they often used excessive force. They also often enjoyed violence, finding it exhilarating.

Sirius is a true embodiment of the chivalrous ideal. He is selfless, honorable, and always puts others before himself. He is the polar opposite of the medieval knights, who were often selfish, dishonorable, and brutal.
