### What are algorithms?
- #defn An algorithm is a well-defined procedure consisting of a sequence of computational steps that take some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.
- An algo is a tool designed to solve a particular computational **problem**
- Ex.
	- #defn Sorting
		- **Problem:** Sort a sequence of numbers in non-decreasing order
		- **Input:** A sequence of numbers $\pi ' = (a_1', ..., a_n')$
		- **Output:** A permutation $\pi ' = (a_1', ..., a_n')$ of $\pi$ such that $a_1' <= a_2' <= ... <= a_n'$
		- An algorithm for the sorting problem is a sequence of computational steps with the above input/output specifications
		- Ex: [8, 10, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3] $=>$ [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10]
	- find median value in a list
	- shortest path
	- optimal shopping method at the supermarket

### Why is the study of algorithms worthwhile?
- Functionality
- Correctness
- Running-time
	- Scalability
- Space/Memory
- Elegance and Simplicity
- Reliability

### How do we **analyze** and **design** algorithms?
- **Analysis:** Focus on techniques to analyze the correctness and running-time of algorithms.
- **Design:** Look at various techniques that will help in designing algorithms, developed to solve particular computational problems.
